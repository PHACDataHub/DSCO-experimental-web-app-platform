# Postgraphile GraphQL API

## Access URL: [http://localhost:8081/graphiql](http://localhost:8081/graphiql)

Need more help or information? See their docs [HERE](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/introduction/)

### How to get it working:
1. Start the containers
2. Restart this container
> It needs an additional reboot since it reads the database too fast (before the migrations) so it doesn't detect that things have changed
3. Navigate to the Access URL and check out all the Queries and Mutations in the Explorer! 🚀
