# üîó GraphQL[^1]

## ‚úîÔ∏è Reasons to use GraphQL:

| Reason      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|**Efficient API development**|GraphQL's flexible data querying and response format allows developers to efficiently build and maintain APIs for web and mobile applications, with reduced network traffic and improved performance.|
|**Client-driven data requests**|With GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they need, eliminating the problem of over-fetching or under-fetching data. This results in faster, more efficient queries and a better user experience.|
|**Strong type system**|GraphQL's type system allows developers to define and validate the shape and structure of their data, making it easier to build and maintain complex APIs over time.|
|**Multiple data sources**|GraphQL can unify data from multiple sources, such as different APIs or databases, into a single API endpoint. This makes it easier to manage and access data across different systems.|
|**Large and growing community**|GraphQL has a large and growing community of developers, with many open-source libraries and tools available for building and testing GraphQL APIs. This community also provides opportunities for learning and collaboration.|

## ‚ùå Reasons not to use GraphQL:

| Reason      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|**Steep learning curve**|GraphQL can be more difficult to learn and implement than traditional REST APIs, especially for developers who are not familiar with its concepts and tools.|
|**More complex backend infrastructure**|GraphQL often requires a more complex backend infrastructure than REST APIs, as it requires specialized tools and libraries to implement, such as a GraphQL server and a schema definition language.|
|**Increased server load**|GraphQL queries can be more complex and data-heavy than traditional REST API calls, which can increase the load on servers and potentially cause performance issues.|
|**Caching challenges**|Due to the flexibility of GraphQL queries, caching data on the client side can be more challenging than with REST APIs, which can lead to slower performance and increased server load.|
|**Limited support for file uploads**|GraphQL does not have native support for file uploads, which can be challenging for applications that require users to upload large files or complex data structures.|
