### Setting up Python Virtual environment

To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. In a terminal (mac/linux) or windows terminal, run the following command in the base directory of this project

```
python -m venv venv
```

That will create a new folder `venv` in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on mac/linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the project dependencies with

```
pip install -r /core-api/requirements.txt
```
