# DSCO Experimental Web App Platform

([Français](#dsco-plate-forme-dapplication-web-expérimentale))

## ⚠️DISCLAIMER

This project is under heavy development and is not by any means, complete. Due to the nature of the development process, the language is currently being handled automatically and therefore may not be accurate. There are many aspects of the project that may not currently work and/or does not directly reflect the technologies that the government has, currently, or will use.

## 📈Project Management and Tracker

This [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/PHACDataHub/projects/10/views/2) is current for DSCO in general although this will encompass the DSCO-experimental-web-app-platform

## 🤔Problem statement that we are trying to solve

There is a lack of 'starting points' for developers to create full-stack internal applications and therefore the code quality, standardization, optimization, and efficiency are all drastically reduced.

We are trying to solve this issue by providing a full-stack application that be be deployed easily and modularity while still having separated components to allow development on smaller portions of the application at a time.

## 👨‍💻Getting Started

### [GitHub Codespace](/docs/EN/github-codespace-deployment.md) or [Local Docker](/docs/EN/local-docker-deployment.md)

Looking to get started using the repo? Take a look at one of the two deployment methods above! 🚀

## 👀Checking out all the APIs

This repo comes with 3 APIs out of the box for you to experiment with and test out for your use cases!

You can get more information about the available APIs and how to configure there in the [API Configuration document](/docs/EN/api-configurations.md)

## 🤓Want to contribute?
Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how we would like the contributions to be structured 😄

To configure your IDE, you might want to start with creating a [Python virtual environment](/docs/EN/local-docker-deployment.md#setting-up-python-virtual-environment) and installing the packages from [requirements.txt](/core-api/requirements.txt)

## ⚠️CLAUSE DE NON-RESPONSABILITÉ

Ce projet est en plein développement et n'est en aucun cas terminé. En raison de la nature du processus de développement, le langage est actuellement géré automatiquement et peut donc ne pas être précis. De nombreux aspects du projet peuvent ne pas fonctionner actuellement et/ou ne reflètent pas directement les technologies que le gouvernement utilise actuellement ou utilisera.
